# Beam
Beam is a project created to practice basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Open `index.html` file to see the result.

## To do
- Fix loads removing - it works only if loads are removed from last to first one
- Add more types of loads - only concentrated loads work at the moment
- Zooming step is too high
